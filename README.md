# API Integration

JSON Placeholder(http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) has two APIs /posts and /comments.
Using the above set of APIs  develop two screens. One that Displays all the posts[each post will contain title, body].
When a Post is clicked, display all the comments for that particular posts[id in post and postId in comment have a Foreign key relationship]
We are looking for a Good Looking UI. Both the screens should be mobile responsive. At-least 3 posts should be displayed in each row.

# Rest API

Write REST APIs to:

    - Insert an Employee Record Into Database. Each Employee Record should consist of Last name, First name and Employee Number.
    - Fetch List of Employees in a paginated manner.
    - You can use MySQL or PostgresSQL or MongoDB for storage
